I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had \\\\\\\\*very\\\\\\\\* loud music. Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Cillian Murphy and the cast of *Oppenheimer* discuss what it's like to work with a singular director like Christopher Nolan.\\\", \\\"score\\\": 0.8342047, \\\"raw_content\\\": null}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"Christopher Nolan - Wikipedia\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Nolan's 12th film was Oppenheimer (2023), a biopic based on J.
