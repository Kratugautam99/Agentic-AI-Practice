# 🤖 Agentic AI Learning

Welcome to **Agentic AI Learning**, a curated playground for building autonomous, goal-driven AI agents using the latest agentic frameworks. This repository brings together powerful tools like LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Phidata, Agno, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to explore the future of intelligent systems.

## 🧠 What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed with:
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**
- **Dynamic Interaction** with environments and other agents

This repo demonstrates how agentic systems can be orchestrated across multiple frameworks to reason, plan, and act with minimal human intervention.
